   ---User Instructions---
  </h2>

  <p>
   This is a multiple choice question and answer test.
  </p>

  <p>
   There are no scores being kept...so, you might think of it as a 'drill'; feel free to answer the same question/s as many times as you like. 
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
   Each question contains a list of 4 possible answers that the user can select from using their mouse...; just click on whatever you believe to be the 'correct' answer to select.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you find you've accidentally made a 'wrong' choice...; and, now, wish to change your mind; then, just simply click to choose a different answer, instead.
  </p>

  <p>
   The answer you've chosen will be displayed as color: 'silver'.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
   When you've made a final guess; and, do no longer wish to change your mind, anymore; clicking the button: [Show answer] will show exactly what the 'correct' answer is.
  </p>

  <p>
   The correct answer will be displayed as colour: green.
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>Good luck! ;-)</p>
