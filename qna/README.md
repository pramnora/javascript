Why Q&A's...?

I like to both learn/and, too, teach.  

One of the best ways to show you 'know' something...;    
is to try and teach it to somebody else who doesn't yet know...???        
For this reason Q&A tests are a very good way to both 'teach/learn'.    

**NOTE**: It's also a very good way of practicing doing 'revision', as well;  
as many times my memory is rather poor; and, therefore, I tend to forget an awful lot...?!    
Doing Q&A's helps to remind me...

Ideas for coming Q&A projects...  

-----

**Project 1**:   

- Create a database holding a number of questions and answers    
- Include a div with title: qna  
- On page load the first question/answer inside of the database is loaded and displayed;    
- plus, there is a [next] button    
- With each press on the [next] button a 'new' question/answer gets loaded in    
- With each user guess...the guess is marked with either: Y/N    
- A note is kept of the score...by adding up all of the right(Y)/wrong(N) answers;    
- Finally, at the end of the test...a score is printed out;   
- or, alternatively, the user might choose to end the test at any given moment;   
...and, still be given a score of how many answers they had gotten either 'correct/wrong' so far.

**Project 2**:  

Create a QNA which presents a Javscript drop down list of options;     
these options allow you to load in different sorts of tests...   
For example:-  

- Foreign Languages...  
- French   
- Japanese  
- Maths...  
- Fractions  
- English...    
- Grammar  

...then, the test is administered...  
according to how many questions/answers there are in that particular database.
