Ideas for coming Q&A projects...

-----

1> Create a database holding questions and answers
2> On page load the first question/answer inside of the database is loaded and displayed;
2> Then, incude a div with title: qna
3> Plus, a next button
4> With each press on the next button a next questions loads in
5> With each user guess...the guess is marked with either: Y/N
6> A note is kept of the score...by adding up all of the right(Y)/wrong(N) answers;
7> Finally, at the end of the test...a score is printed out;
8> or, alternatively, the use might choose to end the test at any given moment;
...and, still be given a score of how many answers they had gotten correct/wrong so far.
