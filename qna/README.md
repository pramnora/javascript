Why Q&A's...?

I like to both learn/and, too, teach.  

One of the best ways to show you 'know' something...;    
is to try and teach it to somebody else who doesn't yet know...???        
For this reason Q&A tests are a very good way to both 'teach/learn'.    

**NOTE**: It's also a very good way of practicing doing 'revision', as well;  
as many times my memory is rather poor; and, therefore, I tend to forget an awful lot...?!    
Doing Q&A's helps to remind me...

Ideas for coming Q&A projects...  

-----

1> Create a database holding a number of questions and answers    
2> Include a div with title: qna  
3> On page load the first question/answer inside of the database is loaded and displayed;    
4> plus, there is a [next] button    
5> With each press on the [next] button a 'new' question/answer gets loaded in    
6> With each user guess...the guess is marked with either: Y/N    
7> A note is kept of the score...by adding up all of the right(Y)/wrong(N) answers;    
8> Finally, at the end of the test...a score is printed out;   
9> or, alternatively, the user might choose to end the test at any given moment;   
...and, still be given a score of how many answers they had gotten either 'correct/wrong' so far.
