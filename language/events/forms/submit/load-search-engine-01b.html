 <!--This code displays a drop down menu list of search engine options:
     AskJeeves
     Google
     Yahoo
     ...the user selects the particular search engine they wish to use;
     then, hit's the [Submit] button;
     this runs a Javascript function called: goToURL();
     ...which, in turn, goes to the selected URL address. 
     ---
     NOTE: The current window gets replaced by a 'new' one...; 
           which is not something I wanted to happen;
           so, this code still remains being a bit buggy in this sense.
           Each time I tried to fix this by adding in: 
           target='_blank';
           ...to the Javascript...; then, the code refused to work, anymore...?!

  <main>
   <form id="frm1" name="frm1" method="get" action="javascript:goToURL()">
    <label for="sel1">Choose a search engine: </label>
    <select id="sel1">
     <!--doing a web search...I found there are 3 possible options: 
         selected disabled hidden

         selected - didn't work, meaning that option was NOT selected
         I also tried using: selected="selected"
         ...but, that didn't work, neither.
      
         hidden - didn't show any text at all...?!

         disabled - meant that option couldn't be selected;
         however, it also printed the text out really 'faint'...
         so, that it was almost unreadable.

         in the end, as a work around, I just decided to add the words:
         'Choose a search engine: '
         ...as being the label text, instead.
