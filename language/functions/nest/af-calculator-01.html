/* Here, purely as an experiment...
   I tried to implement a very simple calculator program...
   which chains together a number of seperate arrow functions
   each representing the main 4 mathematical operations: 

   a> add
   b> subtract
   c> multiply
   d> divide.

   NOTE: Each function takes 2 arguments...
         1 - the total number to start with
         2 - a number representing the mathematical operation to be done
             on that total number  
*/

//*** Create arrow functions...

add      = (numTotal,numToAdd)      => numTotal + numToAdd;
subtract = (numTotal,numToSubtract) => numTotal - numToSubtract;
multiply = (numTotal,numToMultiply) => numTotal * numToMultiply;
divide   = (numTotal,numToDivide)   => numTotal / numToDivide;

//*** Initialise variables...

n1 = 1;
n2 = 2;

//*** make function calls.../then, finally, display output...

console.log(divide(multiply(subtract(add(n1,n2),1),2),2));

/* Explaining the output...

First, we added together...
add(n1,n2)...1+2=3

Second, we subtracted from that total... 
subtract(total,1)...3-1=2 

Third, we multiplied that total...
multiply(total,2)...2x2=4

Finally, we divided that total in half...
divide(total,2)...4/2=2

...and, thus, the final output answer is: 2

The function chaining act, however, makes the code look to be very complex, indeed;
it almost reminds me of seeing PROLOG code...with loads of endless brackets...?!

Still the main point is to prove that doing this sort of thing is possible.
