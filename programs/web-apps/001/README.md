**How to use these web site template files...**

What I've done is to create an *anonymous* web site template...; 
which can be modified and used by anyone for whatever purpose they please.

-----

**The number of files/folders...**

This web site template contains:

- 8 folder directories/
- 7 x [.html] files/
- 1 x [.css] stylesheet file/
- 1 x [.js] javascript file/
- 2 x [.png] image files/(mouse drawings)

...so, altogether this makes a total of 11 files/plus, 8 folders.

-----

**The overall arrangement of each folder/file...**

These web site files are meant to be arrranged in the following order...(for the site to work correctly as is)...;
a top level folder directory...which is used to store 'all' other files/directory folders...
this top level folder directory is called:

- main

-(**NOTE:** You don't have to call the top level folder: main/you could choose to all it: myWebSite/or, indeed, any name you please.  
However, for the rest of the folders/files to work correctly...; then, you will have to use their strict name, instead.)- 

...then, inside of the main folder directory...there are 7 [.html] files

- diary.html
- drawings.html
- index.html
- links.html
- maths.html
- phonebook.html
- to-do.html


...and, 1 sub-directory folder, called...

- resources

...inside of the 'resources' sub-directory folder...there are 3 more sub-directory folders, called: 

- css -> [css01.css]
- images -> drawings -> digital -> mspaint -> [1.png]/[2.png] 
- js -> [js01.js]

...inside, of the 'css' directory folder there is one file, called: [css01.css]  
...inside of the 'images' directory folder there are 3 further sub-directory folders, called: 'drawings/digital/mspaint'...   
...inside of the mspaint directory folder there are 2 image files, called: [1.png]/[2.png]  
...inside of the 'js' directory folder there is one file, called: [js01.js]  

-----

**The structural arrangement of each [.html] file...concerning the body - /body section...** 

Each [.html] web page...inside of the [body - /body] element tags section...is divided up into being 4 separate sub sections...

- nav - /nav
- header - /header
- main - /main
- footer - /footer

...the nav - /nav tags...is where the Main Menu will be written by calling a Javascript function: showMainMenu();  
...the header - /header tags...is where the sites main title heading will be written using Javascript function: writeH1HeaderText();  
...the header - /header tags...also, displays the h2 - /h2 page title heading text...so, that users can know exactly what page it is they're, currently, visiting seeing...;  
...the main - /main tags...shows the pages main content...which is, of course, variable...going from separate page to page.    
...the footer - /footer tags...shows such details as: email/url/copyright/page created/last updated messages.

**NOTES:**

**NOTE(1):** Because, this web site template relies entirely on *Javascript* code for it's navigation...; therefore, the end user **must** have Javascript 'turned on' inside of their web browser for it to work...; otherwise, the site won't work properly as it should; and, you might just see only just 'one' page, alone...and, not any of the rest of the pages...?!

**NOTE(2):** I've included a number of 'screenshots'...; so, that the end user can see for themselves exactly how the...

- folder/file structure should be arranged...  
- as well as, be able to view what is the result of each web page output...

...without actually needing to go download anything.

**NOTE(3):** I will also provide a clickable link...    
which allows the end user to both 'view/test' the site code...  
by seeing it actually up and running inside of their own web browser...;   
again, without needing to go download anything.

**NOTE(4):** Finally here is the link to my GitHub Javascript repository...;   
where you can download all of the files...;   
to go and use -or, rewrite/rebuild- however you please at home.

**NOTE(5):** A mention of my name as being the 'original' author.../  
or, link back to this *README* page...would be greatly appreciated.
