**How to use these web site template files...**

What I've done is to create an anonymous web site template...; 
which can be modified and used by anyone for whatever purpose they please.

**The number of files/folders...**

This web site template contains:

8 folder directories/
7 x [.html] files/
1 x [.css] stylesheet file/
1 x [.js] javascript file.
2 x [.png] image files/(mouse drawings).

**The overall arrangement of each folder/file...**

These web site files are meant to be arrranged in the following order...(for the site to work correctly as is)...;
a top level folder directory...which is used to store 'all' other files/directory folders...
this top level folder directory is called:

- main

...then, inside of the main folder directory...there are 7 [.html] files

- diary.html
- drawings.html
- index.html
- links.html
- maths.html
- phonebook.html
- to-do.html


...and, 1 sub-directory folder, called...

- resources

...inside of the 'resources' sub-directory folder...there are 3 more sub-directory folders, called: 

- css -> [css01.css]
- images -> drawings -> digital -> mspaint -> [1.png]/[2.png] 
- js -> [js01.js]

...inside, of the 'css' directory folder there is one file, called: [css01.css]
...inside of the 'js' directory folder there is one file, called: [js01.js]
...inside of the 'images' directory folder there are 3 further sub-directory folders, called: 'drawings/digital/mspaint'...
...inside of the mspaint directory folder there are 2 image files, called: [1.png]/[2.png]
