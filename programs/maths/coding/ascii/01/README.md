# ASCII Encoder  

What this file does is...  

1> Get user to type in some plain text string.  

2> Next, user clicks with their mouse the button: [ENCODE]  

3> The user text typed in...is translated to become a series of numbers...;  
   these numbers are then outputted to a HTML Div section which is coloured in pink.  

So, if the user were to type in...  
ABC  
...the encoded text would appear as...  
010203  
...where...  
A = 01, the first letter of the alphabet  
B = 02, the second letter of the alphabet  
C = 03, the third letter of the alphabet  
-etc.
