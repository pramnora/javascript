## Introduction

I wanted to be able to **test** my WebDev skills to see just how *fast* I could build a simple and straight forwards: Javascript phonebook application, of the type where you...  

- select name  
- then, click a button to retrieve phone number  

...to be honest, I didn't find this exercise to be particularly easy.  

At first, I thought it would take me just 1/2 an hour or less...  

- keep all 'HTML/CSS/Javascript' code being located together inside of 'one' single web page file    
- develop the UI    
- test the Javascript works  

...then, hours later on...I found myself still working away on it...trying to fix bugs...???    

Also, having to re-write the application...so that it works...  

- not just on the surface UI-User Interface level  
- but, also, that the underlying 'source code' was laid out clear/and, is well commented.

# App. design  
 
The overall application design is really quite simple, and, straight forwards enough...;    
basiclaly, there are just 2 objects:  

1. A HTML select drop down list object,    
   (used to store all of the 'names/phone numbers' data)    
       
2. A div id object,  
   (used for outputting the found data)  

3. Javascript code,    
   (used to get the selected form name/phone number;  
   and, to display taht phone number inside of the div object)

# There are 3 separate versions of this code...

-----

1> CodePen.io

- https://codepen.io/paulramnora/pen/KwdRJWR

**NOTE**: I started off by trying to build the project at CodePen.io;   
but, found a number of bugs...; so, later on, decided to work on fixing all the bugs offline. 

Later on, I returned back to work on the code at CodePen.io...until when I had a fully working application.

2> GitHub source code  

When I had finished working on the version I'd created offline...; 
then, I uploaded that 'source code' my GitHub online a/c.: Javascript repository:

- [https://github.com/pramnora/javascript/blob/master/programs/search/database/phonebook/js/object/js-phonebook-01.html
](https://github.com/pramnora/javascript/blob/master/programs/search/database/phonebook/html/select/js-phonebook-app-a.html)

3> Next, I created a separate 'live' version of this code which is being stored inside of my Netlify a/c.:

- https://pr-phonebook.netlify.app/
  
  
## Code compression

When I looked at what was the original code...I noticed that it consisted of 182 lines in length.  
Then, I had the idea to try and compress the code down...eventually, getting it to become just 8 lines in length.  

Of course, this very highly compressed code does no longer function exactly the same as did the original full blown version;  
however, it is the same code still functioning as before. You just have to add further select 'option="value" by 'copy and paste'.
