# PROGRAM: Find Primes - Version I

This is a web application using a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The 4 included files are listed as follows:-

-> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
-> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
-> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  
-> find-primes.png  (the print out of the program working in actual 'real life' action)  

## REASONS AS TO WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS

I wanted to write a fairly simple application which I could then easily port to other languages...; 
for example, I have written the same code -so far to date- using...

-> Python
-> QBASIC
-> Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
-etc.

...and, I do fully intend to write more...including a C, C++, etc. versions.
