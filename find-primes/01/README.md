# PROGRAM: Find Primes - Version I

This is a 'web application' program which uses a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript to work.

### PROGRAM RUN

> Enter number: 7 [Check if number is prime?]

The program's aim is, after the user has entered a number to check, first;      
and, clicked on button: [Check if number is prime?];  

then, the program checks to see if the number entered was either prime/or, not;  
by using a loop to carry out a series of calculations.
     
When all of the calculations are done; finally, it prints out the following 'output' message:    
(the output will, of course, vary...depending on which number the user did choose to enter)

> Number: 7  
> Factors: 1 7  
> Total factors: 2  
> Prime: Y  

## FILE LISTING

There are 3 interlinked but entirely separate program files:-

1 - find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
2 - find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
3 - find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

...and, also, I went and uploaded 3 printout files(so, people can see the code working in actual action):-

4 - find-primes-01.png  (printout of the entire program working in actual 'real life' action/including source codes...all being shown inside of 1 screenful window...with compressed code)   
5 - find-primes-01b.png  (printout of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a prime number: 7)   
6 - find-primes-01c.png  (printout out of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a non prime number: 10)  

7 - README.md (which is this explnatory file)  

## HOW TO USE IT

There are 2 different ways...

A> Online: If you are online; then, type into your web browser the following web site URL address; now, you can both see/interact with the code running 'live' from inside of your own web browser:

https://epic-hodgkin-ce3d37.netlify.app/find-primes/01/find-primes.html

B> Offline: If you wish to use the code 'offline'...to learn experiment with; then, go and download the 3 main files onto your computer...; making sure that all of these files are kept stored together...inside of one same folder (as opposed to being located inside of different folders); then, click on the file called: [find-primes.html]...and, now, the code should work on your own computer.

1> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
2> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
3> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

## REASONS AS TO WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS PROGRAM

I wanted to write a fairly simple application program which I could then easily port to other languages...; 
for example, I have written the same code -so far to date- using...

-> Python  
-> QBASIC  
-> VBScript  
-> Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript)  
-etc.  

...and, I do fully intend to write more...including a C, C++, TK/Inter, -etc. versions.
