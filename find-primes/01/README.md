# PROGRAM: Find Primes - Version I

This is a web application using a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript.

There are 3 interlinked but entirely separate program files:-

-> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
-> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
-> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

...and, there are 3 printout files:-

-> find-primes.png  (printout of the entire program working in actual 'real life' action/including source codes...all being shown inside of 1 screenful window...with compressed code)   
-> find-primes-b.png  (printout of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a prime number: 7)   
-> find-primes-c.png  (printout out of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a non prime number: 10)   


## REASONS AS TO WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS PROGRAM

I wanted to write a fairly simple application which I could then easily port to other languages...; 
for example, I have written the same code -so far to date- using...

-> Python  
-> QBASIC  
-> VBScript  
-> Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript)  
-etc.  

...and, I do fully intend to write more...including a C, C++, etc. versions.
