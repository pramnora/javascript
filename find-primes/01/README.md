# PROGRAM: Find Primes - Version I

This is a 'web application' program which uses a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript to work.

The program's aim is, after the user has first entered a number to check into the textbox;      
then, clicked on button: [Check if number is prime?];  

next, the program checks to see if the number entered was either prime/or, not;   
it does this by using a for loop/together with the mod % maths operator symbol  
to carry out a series of calculations.

Basically, if the number can be divided, evenly, result: 0; and, without leaving any remainder;
then, that means the number found is a factor.

If the number of factors found is just merely, 2/...as opposed to less than 2/or, more than 2...;  
then, the number found is a 'prime number'.
     
When all of the calculations are done; finally, it prints the following 'output' message:      
(as the examples show, the output will, in fact, vary...depending on which number the user did choose to enter)

### PROGRAM RUN 1/Prime number found...

> Enter number: [7] [Check if number is prime?]
>
> Number: 7  
> Factors: 1 7  
> Total factors: 2  
> Prime: Y  

### PROGRAM RUN 2/No prime number found...

> Enter number: [10] [Check if number is prime?]
>
> Number: 10  
> Factors: 1 2 5 10  
> Total factors: 4  
> Prime: N  

## FILE LISTING

There are 3 interlinked but entirely separate program files:-

1 - find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
2 - find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
3 - find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

...and, also, I went and uploaded 3 printout files(so, people can see the code working in actual action):-

4 - find-primes-01.png  (printout of the entire program working in actual 'real life' action/including source codes...all being shown inside of 1 screenful window...with compressed code)   
5 - find-primes-01b.png  (printout of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a prime number: 7)   
6 - find-primes-01c.png  (printout out of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a non prime number: 10)  

7 - README.md (which is this explanatory file)  

## HOW TO USE IT

There are 2 different ways...

A> Online: If you are currently online; then, either click on the following link/or else, type into your web browser the following URL address; now, you can both 'see/interact' with the code running 'live' from inside of your own web browser:

https://epic-hodgkin-ce3d37.netlify.app/find-primes/01/find-primes.html

B> Offline: If you wish to use the code 'offline'...to learn and experiment with; then, go and download the 3 main files onto your computer...; making sure that all of these files are kept stored in one same place together...such as inside of 'one' same folder (as opposed to being located inside of different folders); then, click on the file called: [find-primes.html]...and, now, the code should automatically launch inside of your own web browser...so that you can run/re-run/test.

1> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
2> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
3> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

## REASONS AS TO WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS PROGRAM

I wanted to write a fairly simple application program which I could then easily port to other languages...; 
for example, I have written the same code -so far to date- using...

-> Python  
-> QBASIC  
-> VBScript  
-> Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript)  
-etc.  

...and, I do fully intend to write more...including a C, C++, TK/Inter, -etc. versions.

## SOME FURTHER NOTES: JAVASCRIPT IS THE MOST WIDELY USED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, NOW-A-DAYS; WITH POPULARITY THAT'S 2ND TO NONE!

When I first learned to write web page code: HTML/CSS, somewhere way back in the 1990's - 2000;  
I recall writing web page code using mainly either: Javascript/or, VBScript;  
(occassionally, I might try experimenting by writing web page code using, PerlScript).

Because my own programming history is, in fact, related to having learned BASIC programming;    
therefore, I much preferred writing web browser code using VBScript/Visual BASIC Script, instead of Javascript.

However, as time moved on...Javascript, seemed to have won the web browser popularity contest;  
as being the main programming language that was most universally accepted for use inside of web browsers.

-(I think, that's mainly because VBScript code only ran inside of Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser, alone;    
  unless, you were to download/add a web browser plug-in...for it to work inside of 'other' web browsers.)-

Eventually, I stopped writing VBScript code to use inside of web browers, anymore;
and, mostly, used Javascript to write inside of the web browser, instead.

But, I did not completely give up on using the BASIC family of programming languages, altogether;    
I just use -(present tense)- those languages in 'offline' mode, instead.  

- VBScript, is a very good language to use on Windows Desktop  
- QBASIC, is a very good language to use for CLI/Command Line Interface development
- Visual BASIC.net, can be used for OOP/Object Oriented Programming/web development  
- etc.

If I had written this same program using: QBASIC/Pascal/C/C++/Python/-etc.;  
then, people might need to go and find/download that particular software
which is necessary in order to make the program run.

Writing Javascript code; therefore, has tremendous advantages/benefits;  
with it being used 'universally' by nearly everyone on the whole entire planet;    
therefore, there is no need to go and find/download anything further at all.
