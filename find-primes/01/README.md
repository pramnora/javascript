# PROGRAM: Find Primes - Version I

This is a web application program which uses a mixture of: HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The program's aim is, after the user has first entered a number to check;       
then, the program checks to see if the number entered was either prime/or, not?   
Next, it prints out the following type of 'output' message:  

Number: 7  
Factors: 1 7  
Total factors: 2  
Prime: Y  

# FILE LISTING

There are 3 interlinked but entirely separate program files:-

-> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
-> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
-> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

...and, also, I went and uploaded 3 printout files(so, people can see the code working in actual action):-

-> find-primes-01.png  (printout of the entire program working in actual 'real life' action/including source codes...all being shown inside of 1 screenful window...with compressed code)   
-> find-primes-01b.png  (printout of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a prime number: 7)   
-> find-primes-01c.png  (printout out of the program working in actual 'real life' action/the program finds a non prime number: 10)  

# HOW TO USE IT

There are 2 different ways...

A> Online: Go to the following web site address; and, you can see/interact with the code running 'live' inside of your own web browser:

https://epic-hodgkin-ce3d37.netlify.app/find-primes/01/find-primes.html

B> Offline: Go and download the 3 main files onto your computer...; making sure that all files are kept stored together...inside of one same folder (as opposed to being located inside of different folders); then, click on the file called: [find-primes.html]...and, now, the code should work on your own computer whlst being in offline mode.

1> find-primes.html (the web page UI/User Interface)  
2> find-primes.css  (adds decorative effects such as colour/font type/-etc. to the web page UI)  
3> find-primes.js   (the computer program which calculates if a number is either prime or not)  

## REASONS AS TO WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS PROGRAM

I wanted to write a fairly simple application program which I could then easily port to other languages...; 
for example, I have written the same code -so far to date- using...

-> Python  
-> QBASIC  
-> VBScript  
-> Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript)  
-etc.  

...and, I do fully intend to write more...including a C, C++, TK/Inter, -etc. versions.
